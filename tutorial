Tesseract installer for Windows
Normally we run Tesseract on Debian GNU Linux, but there was also the need for a Windows version. That's why we have built a Tesseract installer for Windows.

WARNING: Tesseract should be either installed in the directory which is suggested during the installation or in a new directory. The uninstaller removes the whole installation directory. If you installed Tesseract in an existing directory, that directory will be removed with all its subdirectories and files.

The latest installer can be downloaded here:

tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.3.3.20231005.exe (64 bit)
There are also older versions for 32 and 64 bit Windows available.

In addition, we also provide documentation which was generated by Doxygen.
